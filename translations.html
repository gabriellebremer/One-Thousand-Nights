			<p>The history of the <i>Nights</i> is extremely complex and modern scholars
				have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the
				collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin
				summarises their findings:

    <blockquote>In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the <i>Nights</i> by
		Zotenberg and others, in the course of which a consensus view of
		the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the
		<i>Nights</i> was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it
		came from India and Persia. At some time, probably in the early
		8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the
		title <i>Alf Layla</i>, or <i>The Thousand Nights</i>. This collection then
		formed the basis of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>. The original
		core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th
		century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among
		them some tales about the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Also, perhaps
		from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and
		story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the
		13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in
		Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex,
		magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories
		were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk
		of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full
		1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.</blockquote>

<h3>Possible Indian Influence</h3>
		<p>Devices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and
			animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of
			the conception of the <i>Nights</i>. The motif of the wise young
			woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling
			stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore
			is represented in the <i>Nights</i> by certain animal stories, which reflect
			influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the <i>Panchatantra</i>
			and <i>Baital Pachisi</i> is particularly notable. <i>The Jataka Tales</i> are a
			collection of 547 Buddhist stories, which are for the most part moral
			stories with an ethical purpose. <i>The Tale of the Bull and the Ass</i> and the
			linked <i>Tale of the Merchant</i> and his Wife are found in the frame stories of
			both the <i>Jataka</i> and the <i>Nights</i>.

		<br>
	<div class="redlampsimage">
		It is possible that the influence of the <i>Panchatantra</i> is via a Sanskrit
		adaptation called the <i>Tantropakhyana</i>. Only fragments of the original
		Sanskrit form of this work survive, but translations or adaptations exist
		in Tamil, Lao, Thai, and Old Javanese. The frame story is
		particularly interesting, as it follows the broad outline of a concubine
		telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a
		king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the
		<i>Panchatantra</i>—with its original Indian setting.
		<br>
		The <i>Panchatantra</i> and various tales from <i>Jatakas</i> were first translated
		into Persian by Borzūya in 570 CE, they were later translated into
		Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in 750 CE. The Arabic version was translated
		into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.

<h3>Persian prototype: Hezār Afsān</h3>
		<p>The earliest mentions of the <i>Nights</i> refer to it as an Arabic translation
			from a Persian book, Hezār Afsān (or Afsaneh or Afsana), meaning
			<i>The Thousand Stories</i>. In the 10th century Ibn al-Nadim compiled a
			catalogue of books (the <i>Fihrist</i>) in Baghdad. He noted that the Sassanid
			kings of Iran enjoyed "evening tales and fables". Al-Nadim then writes
			about the Persian Hezār Afsān, explaining the frame story it employs: a
			bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding
			night; eventually one has the intelligence to save herself by telling him
			a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night
			so that the king will delay her execution. However, according to
			al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly
			of the collection's literary quality, observing that "it is truly a coarse
			book, without warmth in the telling". In the same century Al-Masudi
			also refers to the Hezār Afsān, saying the Arabic translation is called
			<i>Alf Khurafa</i> (<i>A Thousand Entertaining Tales</i>) but is generally known as
			<i>Alf Layla</i> (<i>A Thousand Nights</i>). He mentions the characters Shirāzd
			(Scheherazade) and Dināzād.
		<br>
			No physical evidence of the Hezār Afsān has survived, so its exact
			relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery.
			Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian
			origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection. These
			stories include the cycle of <i>King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas</i> and <i>The
			Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son</i> (derived from the
			7th-century Persian Bakhtiyārnāma).
		<br>
			In the 1950s, the Iraqi scholar Safa Khulusi suggested (on internal rather
			than historical evidence) that the Persian writer Ibn al-Muqaffa' may have
			been responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and
			some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the <i>Nights</i>. This would
			place genesis of the collection in the 8th century.
			</p>

<h3>Evolving Arabic Versions</h3>
		<p>In the mid-20th century, the scholar Nabia Abbott found a document
			with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title <i>The Book of the Tale of
			a Thousand Nights</i>, dating from the 9th century. This is the earliest known
			surviving fragment of the <i>Nights</i>. The first reference to the Arabic
			version under its full title <i>The One Thousand and One Nights</i> appears in
			Cairo in the 12th century. Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the
			subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:
		<br>
    	<blockquote>Some of the earlier Persian tales may have survived within the Arabic
			tradition altered such that Arabic Muslim names and new locations were
			substituted for pre-Islamic Persian ones, but it is also clear that whole
			cycles of Arabic tales were eventually added to the collection and
			apparently replaced most of the Persian materials. One such cycle of Arabic
			tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century
			Baghdad, including the caliph Harun al-Rashid (died 809), his vizier Jafar
			al-Barmaki (d. 803) and the licentious poet Abu Nuwas (d. c. 813). Another
			cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned
			persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth
			centuries.</blockquote>

			Two main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian
			and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition includes the oldest manuscripts;
			these versions are also much shorter and include fewer tales. It is
			represented in print by the so-called Calcutta I (1814–1818) and most
			notably by the Leiden edition (1984), which is based above all on the
			Galland manuscript. The Leiden Edition, prepared by Muhsin Mahdi,
			is the only critical edition of 1001 Nights to date, believed to be
			most stylistically faithful representation of mediaeval Arabic versions
			currently available.
		<br>
			Texts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales
			of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally
			independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the
			centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written,
			and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps
			in order to attain the eponymous number of 1001 nights. The final product
			of this tradition, the so-called Zotenberg Egyptian Recension, does
			contain 1001 nights and is reflected in print, with slight variations,
			by the editions known as the Bulaq (1835) and the Macnaghten or Calcutta
			II (1839–1842).
		<br>

		All extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common
		core of tales:
		<br>
		<ul>
    <li>The Merchant and the Genie</li>
    <li>The Fisherman and the Genie</li>
    <li>The Porter and the Three Ladies</li>
    <li>The Three Apples</li>
    <li>Nur al-Din Ali and Shams al-Din (and Badr al-Din Hasan)</li>
    <li>The Hunchback cycle</li>
    <li>Nur al-Din Ali and Anis al-Jalis</li>
    <li>Ali Ibn Bakkar and Shams al-Nahar</li>
	</ul>
		The texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core.
		It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more "authentic" and
		closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more
		extensively and more recently, and scholars such as Muhsin Mahdi have
		suspected that this may have been caused in part by European demand for a
		"complete version"; but it appears that this type of modification has been
		common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have
		always been added to it.
</p>

<h3>Modern Translations</h3>
		<p>The first European version (1704–1717) was translated into French by
			Antoine Galland from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other
			sources. This 12-volume work, Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes
			traduits en français (<i>The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories
			translated into French</i>), included stories that were not in the original
			Arabic manuscript. <i>Aladdin's Lamp</i>, and <i>Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</i>
			(as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's
			translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts.
			He wrote that he heard them from a Syrian Christian storyteller from
			Aleppo, a Maronite scholar whom he called "Hanna Diab." Galland's version
			of the <i>Nights</i> was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions
			were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.
		<br>
			<pullquote class="moderntranslationpq">"Les Mille et une nuits,
				contes arabes traduits en français (The Thousand and one
				nights, Arab stories translated into French), included stories
				that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. Aladdin's Lamp,
				and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves."
			</pullquote>
		<br>
			As scholars were looking for the presumed "complete" and "original" form
			of the <i>Nights</i>, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the
			Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the "standard
			version". The first translations of this kind, such as that of Edward
			Lane (1840, 1859), were bowdlerized. Unabridged and unexpurgated
			translations were made, first by John Payne, under the title <i>The Book of
			the Thousand Nights and One Night</i> (1882, nine volumes), and then by Sir
			Richard Francis Burton, entitled <i>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a
			Night</i> (1885, ten volumes) – the latter was, according to some assessments,
			partially based on the former, leading to charges of plagiarism.
			In view of the sexual imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized
			even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on
			Oriental sexual mores) and the strict Victorian laws on obscene material,
			both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers
			only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes
			were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps
			others) entitled <i>The Supplemental Nights</i> to the <i>Thousand Nights and a Night</i>,
			which were printed between 1886 and 1888. It has, however, been criticized
			for its "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on
			sexuality" (and has even been called an "eccentric ego-trip" and a "highly
			personal reworking of the text").

<div class="orangelampsimage">

			Later versions of the <i>Nights</i> include that of the French doctor J. C.
			Mardrus, issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English
			by Powys Mathers, and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it
			is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed
			expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.
		<br>
			A notable recent version, which reverts to the Syrian recension, is a
			critical edition based on the 14th- or 15th-century Syrian manuscript in
			the Bibliothèque Nationale, originally used by Galland. This version,
			known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by Muhsin Mahdi (1984)
			and rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). Mahdi argued that this
			version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today)
			and that it reflects most closely a "definitive" coherent text ancestral to
			all others that he believed to have existed during the Mamluk period (a view
			that remains contentious). Still, even scholars who deny this
			version the exclusive status of "the only real Arabian Nights" recognize it
			as being the best source on the original style and linguistic form of the
			mediaeval work and praise the Haddawy translation as "very readable"
			and "strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic
			flavour of those tales". An additional second volume of Arabian nights
			translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales not present in the Leiden
			edition, was published in 1995.
		<br>
			In 2008 a new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in
			three volumes. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with
			introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete
			translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension)
			since Burton's. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001
			Nights, the so-called "orphan stories" of Aladdin and Ali Baba as well as
			an alternative ending to The seventh journey of Sindbad from Antoine
			Galland's original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface
			to the three volumes, "[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the
			translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ...
			repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text," and
			the work is a "representation of what is primarily oral literature,
			appealing to the ear rather than the eye". The Lyons translation
			includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt
			to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the
			original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this
			sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation.
