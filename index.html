				<h1 class="header">One Thousand and One Nights</h1>

				<p> One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of Middle
					Eastern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic
					Golden Age. It is often known in English as the <i>Arabian
					Nights</i>, from the first English-language edition
					(c. 1706 – c. 1721), which rendered the title as
					<i>The Arabian Nights' Entertainment</i>.
<br>
					The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and
					scholars across West, Central, and South Asia and North
					Africa. Some tales themselves trace their roots back to
					ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Indian, Greek, Jewish
					and Turkish folklore and literature. In particular, many
					tales were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and
					Mamluk eras, while others, especially the frame story, are
					most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hezār
					Afsān (Persian: هزار افسان‎, lit. A Thousand Tales), which
					in turn relied partly on Indian elements.
<br>
					What is common throughout all the editions of the <i>Nights</i> is
					the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryār and his wife
					Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the
					tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale;
					some are framed within other tales, while others are self-contained.
					Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while
					others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in
					'prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and
					riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems
					are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.
<br>
					Some of the stories commonly associated with <i>The Nights</i>, in
					particular <i>"Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp", "Ali Baba and the
					Forty Thieves", and "The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor"</i>,
					were not part of <i>The Nights</i> in its original Arabic versions
					but were added to the collection by Antoine Galland and
					other European translators.</p>
