		<h1>Culture</h1>
			<p>The influence of the versions of <i>The Nights</i> on world literature
				is immense. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib
				Mahfouz have alluded to the collection by name in their own
				works. Other writers who have been influenced by <i>The Nights</i>
				include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, Salman Rushdie, Orhan
				Pamuk, Goethe, Walter Scott, Thackeray, Wilkie Collins,
				Elizabeth Gaskell, Nodier, Flaubert, Marcel Schwob, Stendhal,
				Dumas, Gérard de Nerval, Gobineau, Pushkin, Tolstoy,
				Hofmannsthal, Conan Doyle, W. B. Yeats, H. G. Wells, Cavafy,
				Calvino, Georges Perec, H. P. Lovecraft, Marcel Proust, A. S.
				Byatt and Angela Carter.
<br>
				Various characters from this epic have themselves become
				cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad
				and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from
				improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge.
				The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem
				less incredible if they are set further "long ago" or farther
				"far away"; this process culminates in the fantasy world having
				little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several
				elements from Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy,
				such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When
				L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished
				stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the
				dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.
<br>
				In 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began
				naming features on Saturn's moon Enceladus after characters
				and places in Burton's translation because "its surface
				is so strange and mysterious that it was given the <i>Arabian
				Nights</i> as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a
				literary fantasy".</p>

		<h3>In Arab Culture</h3>
				<p>There is little evidence that <i>The Nights</i> was particularly
					treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists
					of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of
					the collection exist. Fiction had a low cultural status among
					Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed
					as <i>khurafa</i> (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining
					women and children). According to Robert Irwin, "Even today,
					with the exception of certain writers and academics, <i>The Nights</i>
					is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are
					regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above
					all, badly written."
<br>
					Nevertheless, <i>The Nights</i> have proved an inspiration to some modern
					Egyptian writers, such as Tawfiq al-Hakim (author of the Symbolist
					play <i>Shahrazad</i>, 1934), Taha Hussein (<i>Scheherazade's Dreams</i>,
					1943) and Naguib Mahfouz (Arabian Nights and Days, 1981).
					Idries Shah finds the Abjad numerical equivalent of the Arabic
					title, alf layla wa layla, in the Arabic phrase <i>umm el quissa</i>,
					meaning "mother of records". He goes on to state that many of
					the stories "are encoded Sufi teaching stories, descriptions
					of psychological processes, or enciphered lore of one kind or
					another."
<br>
					On a more popular level, film and TV adaptations based on stories
					like Sinbad and Aladdin enjoyed long lasting popularity in
					Arabic speaking countries.</p>

				<h3>Early Influence on European Literature</h3>
					<p>Although the first known translation into a European language only
						appeared in 1704, it is possible that <i>The Nights</i> began exerting
						its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers
						in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly
						philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced
						by Juan Manuel's story collection <i>El Conde Lucanor</i> and Ramón
						Llull's <i>The Book of Beasts</i>. Knowledge of the work, direct or
						indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with
						parallels in <i>The Nights</i> are found in Chaucer's <i>The Canterbury
						Tales</i> (in <i>The Squire's Tale</i> the hero travels on a flying brass
						horse) and Boccaccio's Decameron. Echoes in Giovanni Sercambi's
						<i>Novelle</i> and Ariosto's <i>Orlando Furioso</i> suggest that the story of
						Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known. Evidence also appears
						to show that the stories had spread to the Balkans and a
						translation of the Nights into Romanian existed by the 17th
						century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.</p>

				<h3>Western Literature from the 18th Century Onwards</h3>
					<p>The modern fame of the Nights derives from the first known European
						translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According
						to Robert Irwin, Galland "played so large a part in discovering
						the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what
						would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at
						some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real
						author of the <i>Nights</i>." The immediate success of Galland's
						version with the French public may have been because it coincided
						with the vogue for <i>contes de fées</i> ("fairy stories"). This fashion
						began with the publication of Madame d'Aulnoy's <i>Histoire d'Hypolite</i>
						in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to
						the <i>Nights</i>, with the tales told by a female narrator. The success
						of the <i>Nights</i> spread across Europe and by the end of the century
						there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian,
						Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish. Galland's version
						provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time,
						some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched
						stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek
						pastiches include Anthony Hamilton's <i>Les quatre Facardins</i> (1730),
						Crébillon's <i>Le sopha</i> (1742) and Diderot's <i>Les bijoux indiscrets</i>
						(1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary
						French society. The most famous example is Voltaire's <i>Zadig</i> (1748),
						an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle
						Eastern background. The English versions of the "Oriental
						Tale" generally contained a heavy moralising element, with
						the notable exception of William Beckford's fantasy <i>Vathek</i> (1786),
						which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic
						novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki's novel <i>Saragossa Manuscript</i>
						(begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the <i>Nights</i> with its Oriental flavour
						and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.
<br>
					The work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history,
					and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller Andrew
					Millar (when an apprentice) to a Presbyterian minister. This is
					illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability
					in the 1720s.
<br>
					The <i>Nights</i> continued to be a favourite book of many British
					authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to A. S.
					Byatt, "In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for
					the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the
					prosaically and reductively rational." In their autobiographical
					writings, both Coleridge and de Quincey refer to nightmares the
					book had caused them when young. Wordsworth and Tennyson also
					wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.
					Charles Dickens was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the
					Nights pervades the opening of his last novel The Mystery of
					Edwin Drood (1870).
<br>
					Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,
					including Théophile Gautier (<i>La mille deuxième nuit</i>, 1842)
					and Joseph Roth (<i>Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht,</i> 1939).
					Edgar Allan Poe wrote "The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade" (1845).
					It depicts the eighth and final voyage of Sinbad the Sailor,
					along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter;
					the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While
					the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying
					the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real,
					they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during,
					or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such
					disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her
					executed the very next day.
<br>
					Another important literary figure, the Irish poet W. B. Yeats
					was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in
					his prose book, A Vision an autobiographical poem, titled The
					Gift of Harun Al-Rashid, in relation to his joint experiments
					with his wife Georgie Hyde-Lees, with Automatic writing. The
					automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in
					order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from
					other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen,
					writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's
					eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing
					in Yeats's poem as "a gift" herself, given only allegedly by
					the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher Qusta Ibn
					Luqa, who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats.
					In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in
					the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list
					that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William
					Shakespeare's works.
<br>
					Modern authors influenced by the Nights include James Joyce,
					Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges and John Barth.
</p>

				<h3>Cinema and Television</h3>
					<p>Stories from the One Thousand and One Nights have been popular
						subjects for films, beginning with Georges Méliès' <i>Le Palais des
						Mille et une nuits</i> (1905).
<br>
						The critic Robert Irwin singles out the two versions of <i>The Thief
						of Baghdad</i> (1924 version directed by Raoul Walsh; 1940 version
						produced by Alexander Korda) and Pier Paolo Pasolini's <i>Il fiore
						delle Mille e una notte</i> (1974) as ranking "high among the
						masterpieces of world cinema." Michael James Lundell calls
						Il fiore "the most faithful adaptation, in its emphasis on sexuality,
						of The 1001 Nights in its oldest form."
<br>
						UPA, an American animation studio, produced an animated feature
						version of <i>1001 Arabian Nights</i> (1959), featuring the cartoon
						character Mr. Magoo.
<br>
						The 1949 animated film <i>The Singing Princess</i>, another movie produced
						in Italy, is inspired by The Arabian Nights. The animated feature
						film, <i>One Thousand and One Arabian Nights</i> (1969), produced in Japan
						and directed by Osamu Tezuka and Eichii Yamamoto, featured psychedelic
						imagery and sounds, and erotic material intended for adults.
<br>
						Alif Laila (The Arabian Nights), a 1997–2002 Indian TV series based
						on the stories from <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> produced by Sagar
						Entertainment Ltd, starts with Scheherazade telling her stories to
						Shahryār, and contains both the well-known and the lesser-known
						stories from <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>.
<br>
						<i>Arabian Nights</i> (2000), a two-part television mini-series adopted
						for BBC and ABC studios, starring Mili Avital, Dougray Scott, and
						John Leguizamo, and directed by Steve Barron, is based on the
						translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton.
<br>
						Shabnam Rezaei and Aly Jetha created, and the Vancouver-based Big
						Bad Boo Studios produced <i>1001 Nights</i> (2012), an animated television
						series for children, which launched on Teletoon and airs in 80
						countries around the world, including Discovery Kids Asia.
<br>
						<i>Arabian Nights</i> (2015, in Portuguese: <i>As Mil e uma Noites</i>), a
						three-part film directed by Miguel Gomes, is based on <i>One
						Thousand and One Nights</i>.
