		<h1>Literary Themes and Techniques</h1>

			<p>The <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> and various tales within it make use
				of many innovative literary techniques, which the storytellers of the
				tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions.
				Some of these date back to earlier Persian, Indian and Arabic literature,
				while others were original to the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>.</p>

				<h3>Frame Story</h3>
					<p>An early example of the frame story, or framing device, is
						employed in the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>, in which the character
						Scheherazade narrates a set of tales (most often fairy tales) to
						the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales
						are also frame stories, such as the <i>Tale of Sinbad the Seaman</i> and
						<i>Sinbad the Landsman</i> being a collection of adventures related by
						Sinbad the Seaman to Sinbad the Landsman.</p>

				<h3>Embedded Narrative</h3>
						<p>An early example of the "story within a story" technique can be
						found in the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>, which can be traced back
						to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably
						the <i>Panchatantra</i> of ancient Sanskrit literature. The <i>Nights</i>,
						however, improved on the <i>Panchatantra</i> in several ways, particularly
						in the way a story is introduced. In the <i>Panchatantra</i>, stories
						are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring
						to these stories with variants of the phrase "If you're not
						careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will
						happen to you." In the <i>Nights</i>, this didactic framework is the
						least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story
						is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an
						answer to questions raised in a previous tale.
<br>
						The general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this
						narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In most of
						Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and
						even in some of these, there are some other stories. This is
						particularly the case for the <i>Sinbad the Sailor</i> story narrated
						by Scheherazade in the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>. Within the
						<i>Sinbad the Sailor</i> story itself, the protagonist Sinbad, the
						Sailor, narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the
						Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such
						as <i>The Three Apples</i> and <i>The Seven Viziers</i>. In yet another
						tale Scheherazade narrates, <i>The Fisherman and the Jinni</i>, the
						<i>Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban</i> is narrated within it, and
						within that there are three more tales narrated. </p>

				<h3>Dramatic Visualization</h3>
						<p>Dramatic visualization is "the representing of an object or
							character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic
							rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a
							given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience".
							This technique is used in several tales of the <i>One Thousand and
							One Nights</i>. An example of this is the tale of <i>The Three
							Apples</i> (see Crime fiction elements below).</p>

				<h3>Fate and Destiny</h3>
						<p>A common theme in many Arabian Nights tales is fate and destiny.
							The Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini observed:

    					<blockquote>"Every tale in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> begins with an
							'appearance of destiny' which manifests itself through an anomaly,
							and one anomaly always generates another. So a chain of anomalies
							is set up. And the more logical, tightly knit, essential this chain
							is, the more beautiful the tale. By 'beautiful' I mean vital,
							absorbing and exhilarating. The chain of anomalies always tends
							to lead back to normality. The end of every tale in the <i>One
							Thousand and One Nights</i> consists of a 'disappearance' of destiny,
							which sinks back to the somnolence of daily life ...
							The protagonist of the stories is in fact destiny itself.</blockquote>

							Though invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the
							<i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>. The plot devices often used to present
							this theme are coincidence, reverse causation and the
							self-fulfilling prophecy (see Foreshadowing below).</p>

				<h3>Foreshadowing</h3>
					<p>Early examples of the foreshadowing technique of repetitive
						designation, now known as "Chekhov's gun", occur in the <i>One
						Thousand and One Nights</i>, which contains "repeated references to
						some character or object which appears insignificant when first
						mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the
						narrative". A notable example is in the tale of <i>The Three
						Apples</i> (see Crime fiction elements below).
<br>
						Another early foreshadowing technique is formal patterning, "the
						organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute
						a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal
						patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and
						anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds". This
						technique is also found in <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>.
<br>
						Another form of foreshadowing is the self-fulfilling prophecy,
						which dates back to the story of Krishna in ancient Sanskrit
						literature, and Oedipus or the death of Heracles in the plays of
						Sophocles. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling
						dream, which can be found in Arabic literature (or the dreams of
						Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the Hebrew Bible).
						Several tales in the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> use this device
						to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary
						prolepsis. A notable example is <i>The Ruined Man who Became Rich
						Again through a Dream</i>, in which a man is told in his dream to
						leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he
						will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man
						travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail,
						where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks
						the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he
						himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain
						in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man
						recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released
						from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other
						words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but
						the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant
						of this story later appears in English folklore as the <i>Pedlar of
						Swaffham</i> and Paulo Coelho's <i>The Alchemist</i>; Jorge Luis Borges'
						collection of short stories <i>A Universal History of Infamy</i> featured
						his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as <i>The Story
						Of The Two Dreamers.</i>
<br>
						Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in <i>The
						Tale of Attaf</i>, where Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the
						House of Wisdom), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and
						weeping and dismisses the faithful vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya from
						sight. Ja'afar, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into
						a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman
						whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar
						reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and
						discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In
						other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked
						the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an
						early example of reverse causation. Near the end of the tale,
						Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he didn't commit but
						Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents
						this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century,
						this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included
						in his <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>, alongside the "Sindibad" story
						cycle. In the 14th century, a version of <i>The Tale of Attaf</i>
						also appears in the Gesta Romanorum and Giovanni Boccaccio's
						<i>The Decameron.</i>
</p>

				<h3>Repetition</h3>
						<p>Leitwortstil is 'the purposeful repetition of words' in a given
							literary piece that "usually expresses a motif or theme important
							to the given story". This device occurs in the <i>One Thousand and
							One Nights</i>, which binds several tales in a story cycle. The
							storytellers of the tales relied on this technique "to shape the
							constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole."

							Thematic patterning is "the distribution of recurrent thematic
							concepts and moralistic motifs among the various incidents and
							frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic
							patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument
							or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have
							in common". This technique is also used in the <i>One Thousand and
							One Nights</i>.

							Several different variants of the <i>Cinderella</i> story, which has
							its origins in the Egyptian story of <i>Rhodopis</i>, appear in the <i>One
							Thousand and One Nights</i>, including <i>The Second Shaykh's Story</i>,
							<i>The Eldest Lady's Tale</i> and <i>Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers</i>,
							all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two
							jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while
							in others they are male. One of the tales, <i>Judar and His Brethren</i>,
							departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks
							the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger
							brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.
						</p>

				<h3>Sexual Humor</h3>
						<p>The Nights contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this
							borders on satire, as in the tale called <i>Ali with the Large
							Member</i> which pokes fun at obsession with human penis size.
						</p>

				<h3>Unreliable Narrator</h3>
						<p>The literary device of the unreliable narrator was used in several
							fictional medieval Arabic tales of the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>.
							In one tale, <i>The Seven Viziers</i> (also known as <i>Craft and Malice
							of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the
							Seven Wazirs</i>), a courtesan accuses a king's son of having assaulted
							her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by
							the Qur'anic/Biblical story of Yusuf/Joseph). Seven viziers
							attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove
							the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds by
							narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers.
							The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense
							in <i>The Three Apples</i> and humor in <i>The Hunchback's Tale</i> (see
							Crime fiction elements below).
						</p>

				<h3>Crime Fiction Elements</h3>
						<p>An example of the murder mystery and suspense thriller genres
							in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective
							fiction elements was <i>The Three Apples</i>, also known as <i>Hikayat
							al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula</i> (<i>The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman</i>).
							In this tale, Harun al-Rashid comes to possess a chest,
							which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun
							gives his vizier, Ja'far, three days to find the culprit or be
							executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be
							executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming
							to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that,
							although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible
							for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had
							taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the
							woman's murder. Harun then gives Ja'far three more days to find
							the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit,
							and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers
							by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from
							Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.
<br>
							Another Nights tale with crime fiction elements was <i>The
							Hunchback's Tale</i> story cycle which, unlike <i>The Three Apples</i>,
							was more of a suspenseful comedy and courtroom drama rather than a
							murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional
							China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite
							comedian, being invited to dinner by a tailor couple. The hunchback
							accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the
							couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body
							to a Jewish doctor's clinic and leave him there. This leads to
							the next tale in the cycle, the "]<i>Tale of the Jewish Doctor</i>, where
							the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls
							down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to
							believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his
							body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the
							cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to
							all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in
							a courtroom, all making different claims over how the hunchback
							had died. Crime fiction elements are also present near the
							end of <i>The Tale of Attaf</i> (see Foreshadowing above).
						</p>

				<h3>Horror Fiction Elements</h3>
						<p>Haunting is used as a plot device in gothic fiction and horror
							fiction, as well as modern paranormal fiction. Legends about
							haunted houses have long appeared in literature. In particular,
							the Arabian Nights tale of <i>Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House
							in Baghdad</i> revolves around a house haunted by jinns. The
							<i>Nights</i> is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that
							mentions ghouls, and many of the stories in that collection involve
							or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story <i>The History of
							Gherib and His Brother Agib</i> (from Nights vol. 6), in which Gherib,
							an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then
							enslaves them and converts them to Islam.
<br>
							Horror fiction elements are also found in <i>The City of Brass</i> tale,
							which revolves around a ghost town.
<br>
							The horrific nature of Scheherazade's situation is magnified in
							Stephen King's, <i>Misery</i>, in which the protagonist is forced to write
							a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The
							influence of the <i>Nights</i> on modern horror fiction is certainly
							discernible in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. As a child, he was
							fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he
							attributes some of his creations to his love of the <i>1001 Nights</i>.
						</p>

				<h3>Fantasy and Science Fiction Elements</h3>
						<p> Several stories within the <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> feature
								early science fiction elements. One example is <i>The Adventures
								of Bulukiya</i>, where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the
								herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to
								Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different
								worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of
								galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies
								of djinn, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and
								other forms of life. In <i>Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl
								Tawaddud</i>, the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on
								the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects
								of the planets.
<br>
								In another <i>1001 Nights</i> tale, <i>Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah
								the Merman</i>, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the
								ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater
								society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society
								on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of
								primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do
								not exist. Other <i>Arabian Nights</i> tales also depict Amazon societies
								dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient
								civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed
								them. <i>The City of Brass</i> features a group of travellers on
								an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an
								ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that
								Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way,
								encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike
								humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing
								without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the
								party towards the ancient city, which has now become a ghost
								town. The <i>Third Qalandar's Tale</i> also features a robot in
								the form of an uncanny boatman.
						</p>

				<h3>Poetry</h3>
							<p>There is an abundance of Arabic poetry in <i>One Thousand and One
								Nights</i>. Characters occasionally provide poetry in certain
								settings, covering many uses. However, pleading, beseeching and
								praising the powerful is the most significant.
							The uses would include but are not limited to:
							<ul>
								<li>Giving advice, warning, and solutions</li>
								<li>Praising God, royalties and those in power</li>
								<li>Pleading for mercy and forgiveness</li>
								<li>Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck</li>
								<li>Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges</li>
								<li>Criticizing elements of life, wondering</li>
								<li>Expressing feelings to others or one's self:happiness, sadness, andxiety, surprise, and anger</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself
								from Night 203, <i>Prince Qamar Al-Zaman</i>, standing outside the
								castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival. He wraps
								his ring in a paper and hands it to the servant who delivers it
								to the Queen. When she opens it and sees the ring, joy conquers
								her, and out of happiness she chants this poem:

  						<blockquote>  وَلَقـدْ نَدِمْـتُ عَلى تَفَرُّقِ شَمْــلِنا :: دَهْـرَاً وّفاضَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْ أَجْفـاني
    										وَنَـذَرْتُ إِنْ عـادَ الزَّمـانُ يَلُمـُّـنا :: لا عُــدْتُ أَذْكُــرُ فُرْقًــةً بِلِســاني
    										هَجَــمَ السُّــرورُ عَلَــيَّ حَتَّـى أَنَّهُ :: مِـنْ فَــرَطِ مـا سَــرَّني أَبْكــــاني
    										يا عَيْـنُ صـارَ الدَّمْـعُ مِنْكِ سِجْيَةً :: تَبْكيــنَ مِـنْ فَـــرَحٍ وَأَحْزانـــــي</blockquote>

						Transliteration:

    					<blockquote>Wa-laqad nadimtu 'alá tafarruqi shamlinā :: Dahran wa-fāḍa ad-dam'u min ajfānī
    					Wa-nadhartu in 'āda az-zamānu yalumanā :: la 'udtu adhkuru furqatan bilisānī
    					Hajama as-sarūru 'alayya ḥattá annahu :: min faraṭi mā sarranī abkānī
    					Yā 'aynu ṣāra ad-dam'u minki sijyatan :: tabkīna min faraḥin wa-'aḥzānī</blockquote>

						Literal Translation:
							<blockquote>And I have regretted the separation of our companionship :: An eon, and tears flooded my eyes
							And I've sworn if time brought us back together :: I'll never utter any separation with my tongue
							Joy conquered me to the point of :: which it made me happy that I cried
							Oh eye, the tears out of you became a principle :: You cry out of joy and out of sadness
							</blockquote>

						Burton's verse translation:

    						<blockquote>Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves,
								With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning rain
    						And vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, My lips should
								never speak of severance again:Joy hath o'erwhelmed me so that,
								for the very stress Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am
								fain.Tears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, So that ye weep
								as well for gladness as for pain.</blockquote>
