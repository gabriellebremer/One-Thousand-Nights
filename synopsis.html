<p>The main frame story concerns Shahryār (Persian: شهريار‎, from
	Middle Persian šahr-dār, lit. "holder of realm"), whom the
	narrator calls a "Sasanian king" ruling in "India and China".
	 Shahryār is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is
	 unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has
	 been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness
	 and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār
	 begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each
	 one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him.
	 Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot
	 find any more virgins. Scheherazade (Persian/ Farsi: شهْرزاد
	 Shahrazād, from Middle Persian čehr شهر, "lineage" + āzād ازاد,
	 "noble"), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the
	 next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of
	 their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale,
	 but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story
	 ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to
	 hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes
	 the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear
	 the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution
	 once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights,
	 hence the name.
<br>
	 The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories,
	 tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of
	 erotica. Numerous stories depict jinns, ghouls, apes, sorcerers,
	 magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with
	 real people and geography, not always rationally. Common
	 protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid,
	 his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu
	 Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years
	 after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale
	 of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's
	 tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and
	 that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a
	 richly layered narrative texture.
<br>
	 The different versions have different individually detailed endings
	 (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees
	  their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some '
		other things happen that make the king distracted) but they
		all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing
		her life.

		The narrator's standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger
		seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a
		story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life
		or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full
		text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an
		exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex
		points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a
		detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and
		in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her
		belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy
		her another day of life. </p>
